### Project Description:

Our project is called "Let's Decide" since it is about the user making an important decision. Essentially, a group of 4 people cannot decide on the art-style for their comic and it follows them "into" their mind - a forest - and they reach a crossroad where they have to choose an abstract or oil painting art-style. "Let's Decide" follows the conventions of a comic book, however we have adapted these conventions for the web, like having each panel adapt to the widescreen size of a webpage instead of gutters to separate.

At the end of each path when the user makes the choice, the final panels both agree that this method is not a good idea and we should start again! And the user is prompted to start again via a button *inside* the speech bubble. Basically, this causes the user to play again and try the different path, no matter which path they took which is a funny way of looking at how difficult it is to make simple decisions, that we just go round and round...

### Process:

Our group was tasked to create a 6 panel "interactive" comic using 2D software to create the content and html/css/javascript to put it on the web and incorporate the interactivity. When we sat down to discuss ideas, we decided on the interactivity first, and then came up with ideas for the comic's storyline. We wanted to have a pick your own path scenario at one point during the comic, which meant that the user will have to make a decision - so why not make the comic about making a decision between two things? We concluded with a very meta narrative that calls attention to the medium of the "comic" itself.

**Initial ideas written by our group on a shared google doc, the final idea was highlighted:**

Using a tablet, we sketched rough panels that then gave a good insight for the whole group into what the final product would look like. Aspects like the parallax scroll zoom into the thought bubble and the two path buttons in the forest made it into our final comic which shows that we stuck to our plan and that we planned it well.

**Concept sketch done by Omar for the panels with arrows showing the way we want the user to navigate it:**

When it came to the code, we used the parallax scroll template from class and modified it to fit our needs. For each div, which individually takes up the dimensions of the screen, we added a template image from the internet that mirrored our storyboard. That way, we can work on the code first and make everything funtion as we desired before continuing the artistic aspects of our project.

**Photos from internet used as a template for the comic, with added comments for ideas on speech bubbles and actions:**

In addition to the incorporating the visual nature of the panels, we also added sound. The first panel has classroom sounds on autoplay, which pauses once the user reaches the next panel div. Simultaneously, the sound of a spooky forets plays. One of the final things we added was a homescreen with a button that lets the user start the comic and also gives them a small teaser for what's to come.
