### Project Description:


### Process:

Our group was tasked to create a 6 panel "interactive" comic using 2D software to create the content and html/css/javascript to put it on the web and incorporate the interactivity. When we sat down to discuss ideas, we decided on the interactivity first, and then came up with ideas for the comic's storyline. We wanted to have a pick your own path scenario at one point during the comic, which meant that the user will have to make a decision - so why not make the comic about making a decision between two things? We concluded with a very meta narrative that calls attention to the medium of the "comic" itself.

**Initial ideas written by our group on a shared google doc, the final idea was highlighted:**

Using a tablet, we sketched rough panels that then gave a good insight for the whole group into what the final product would look like. Things like the scroll zoom into the thought bubble and the two paths in the forest made it into our final comic which shows that we stuck our plan and planned it well.

**Concept sketch done by Omar for the panels and the way we want the user to navigate it:**

**Photos from internet used as a template for the comic, with added comments for ideas on speech bubbles and actions:**
